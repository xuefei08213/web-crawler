# Tips That Shaped My Path to CTO
  
https://shamun.dev/posts/cto-tips?ref=dailydev

I've been developing software since middle school, earning my first dollars in high school and climbing to become a CTO in three different organizations (two owned by me). During this journey (almost 20 years 🤯), I learned a lot, and I'd like to share tips from my journey that will hopefully help you.

我从中学时代就开始开发软件，高中时期就赚到了自己的第一桶金，并在三家不同的公司（其中两家是我自己创办的）晋升为 CTO。在这段旅程（将近 20 年！）中，我学到了很多，我想分享一些我在这段旅程中学到的经验，希望对你们有所帮助。
## Go Wide

## 走宽


As an engineer, you can either be a generalist and grow your skills horizontally or choose to be a specialist and dedicate your time to a narrow set of technologies to become highly proficient with them. Throughout my career, I have worked with many languages. I started with C and C++, made my first few dollars thanks to PHP and C#, and today I write in JavaScript, Go, and Python. Additionally, I've built projects in various domains: 3D games, web development, deep learning, computer vision, data processing, DevOps, and more.

作为一名工程师，你可以选择成为通才，横向拓展技能，也可以选择成为专家，专注于一组狭窄的技术，从而精通它们。在我的职业生涯中，我使用过许多语言。我从 C 和 C++开始，通过 PHP 和 C#赚了第一桶金，现在我使用 JavaScript、Go 和 Python 进行编写。此外，我还在多个领域构建了项目：3D 游戏、Web 开发、深度学习、计算机视觉、数据处理、DevOps 等。

I'm no specialist in any of them, so my capabilities are pretty limited, and there will always be someone more talented than me. However, I can build complex products by myself and, when needed, collaborate with specialists to achieve better results. As a CTO, being a generalist helps me a lot. I was able to build daily.dev myself for a long time until we had the money and needed to hire specialists and expand the team. Now, the team consists of both generalists and specialists, each good for different sets of problems. Note: This is a highly subjective take, so make sure being a generalist aligns with your goals.

我在这些领域都不是专家，所以我的能力相当有限，总会有人比我更有天赋。但是，我可以自己构建复杂的产品，并且在需要时与专家合作以取得更好的成果。作为首席技术官，作为通才对我帮助很大。我能够长时间独自构建 daily.dev，直到我们有钱并需要聘请专家和扩大团队。现在，团队既有通才又有专家，每个人都擅长不同的问题集。注意：这是一个非常主观的看法，因此请确保成为通才符合你的目标。
## Be Passionate

## 充满激情


To be great at what you do, you need to be passionate about it. You need to have the spark in your eyes. If you have yet to find the driver that can make you code for hours, search for it. It's the fuel for your journey. For me, it was all about learning and building new products. I get so hyped just by reading about new tech and imagining what I can do with it, not to mention the rush of creating a new project. Nurturing this passion by following it and exploring uncharted territories taught me a lot and still does.

要想在你所做的事情上取得卓越成就，你必须对它充满热情。你需要眼中有火花。如果你还没有找到能让你连续编码数小时的动力，那就去寻找它吧。它是你旅程的燃料。对我来说，就是学习和构建新产品。我只是通过阅读新技术并想象我可以用它做什么就会感到非常兴奋，更不用说创建新项目的兴奋了。通过追随它并探索未知领域来培养这种热情教会了我很多东西，而且至今仍在继续。
## Be Bold

## 大胆


Try things, explore, be adventurous, make mistakes—it's the only way to learn and grow. Most people like to be conservative; they don't like risks. By being bold, you already separate yourself from the crowd, sometimes for better and sometimes for worse. I believe that in the long run, it pays off. I remember using Node.js before it was a thing, before even the first major release, when everyone thought it would be crazy to run JavaScript on the server, but I learned it nevertheless. When the hype was real, I was already experienced and battle-tested with it, which gave me a huge advantage.

尝试新事物，探索未知，勇于冒险，不怕犯错——这是学习和成长的唯一途径。大多数人喜欢保守，不喜欢冒险。而你敢于冒险，就已经与其他人区分开来，有时可能更好，有时可能更糟。我相信，从长远来看，这是值得的。我记得在 Node.js 还不是一个东西，甚至在第一个主要版本发布之前，我就已经在使用它了，当时大家都认为在服务器上运行 JavaScript 是疯狂的，但我还是学会了它。当它真正成为热门话题时，我已经有了相关经验和实战磨练，这给了我很大的优势。

On the other hand, I also bet on web components and Polymer—a decade later, it's still not a thing. You win some, you lose some, but every adventure teaches you something and takes you one step further to becoming great.

另一方面，我也曾押注于 Web 组件和 Polymer——十年过去了，它仍然没有成为现实。有得有失，但每一次冒险都会让你学到一些东西，并让你更接近成功。
## Plan

## 计划


I wish I'd done this more often in my journey. Dedicating enough time to plan before you take action can save you a lot of headaches. Since I have a strong action bias, I code almost immediately, hoping to figure out most of the puzzle as I go. It works every time, as a matter of fact, but sometimes it could have been more efficient with a proper plan. So, take the time to plan, research, and find the tools and solutions you need. As part of the research, you will discover new tech that has nothing to do with your current problem but may be interesting to explore later. Note it down and get back to it when you have the time.

我希望在我的旅程中更经常地这样做。在采取行动之前，花足够的时间计划可以为你省去很多麻烦。由于我有强烈的行动倾向，我几乎立即编写代码，希望在进行过程中解决大部分难题。实际上，每次都有效，但有时如果有一个适当的计划，效率会更高。因此，花时间计划、研究，并找到你需要的工具和解决方案。作为研究的一部分，你将发现与当前问题无关但以后可能有兴趣探索的新技术。记录下来，有时间再回来研究。
## 9 to 5 is a Myth

## 9 到 5 是个神话


If you want to stand out and be great, working 9 to 5 is bullshit. It doesn't mean you have to work extra hours for your workplace, but it means you have to dedicate more time to learning and growing. But hey, if you're passionate about it, you'll enjoy it anyway, right? 😉 Jokes aside, build side projects, give extra hours to your workplace, learn, and try out new things during this time. If everyone does 9 to 5, you need to be better to grow faster. It's easy.

如果你想脱颖而出并变得出色，朝九晚五的工作模式就是扯淡。这并不是说你必须为工作场所额外加班，而是意味着你需要投入更多的时间来学习和成长。但话说回来，如果你对它充满激情，无论如何你都会享受其中，对吧？😉 不开玩笑了，在这段时间里，你可以建立副业、为工作场所付出额外的时间、学习并尝试新事物。如果每个人都朝九晚五，那么你需要更出色才能更快地成长。就这么简单。

Early in my career, I held a full-time position during the day while working on other projects at night and on weekends, barely sleeping 5 hours a day. Even today, I work way more than 9 to 5 but dedicate my focus to only one project, which is daily.dev at the moment. I find it easier than spreading my attention, and it's the only thing I care about currently.

在我的职业生涯早期，我白天有一份全职工作，晚上和周末还要做其他项目，每天只睡 5 个小时左右。即使是今天，我的工作时间也远远超过朝九晚五，但我只专注于一个项目，那就是目前的 daily.dev。我觉得这样更容易集中注意力，这也是我目前唯一关心的事情。
## Stay Up to Date

## 保持最新状态


At some point in my career, I realized that staying up to date is crucial to being top of the class. You must know the latest trends, tools, perspectives, and approaches. As the old saying goes, if all you have is a hammer, everything looks like a nail. The more knowledge you have, the more problems you can solve. This eventually led me to build daily.dev, but before that, I used RSS readers and social media to get the latest news. I dedicated days to perfecting this setup and making it viable.

在我的职业生涯中，我意识到保持与时俱进对于成为行业顶尖至关重要。你必须了解最新的趋势、工具、观点和方法。正如老话说的，如果你只有一把锤子，那么所有问题看起来都像是钉子。你拥有的知识越多，能够解决的问题就越多。这最终促使我创建了 daily.dev，但在此之前，我使用 RSS 阅读器和社交媒体来获取最新消息。我花了几天时间来完善这个设置，并使其变得可行。

Voilà! These tips helped me reach my professional goals. Make them yours, and adjust them to your goals. Every journey is unique; enjoy it!

瞧！这些建议帮助我实现了职业目标。将它们变成你自己的，并根据你的目标进行调整。每个人的旅程都是独一无二的；享受它吧！
