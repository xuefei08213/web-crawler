## Rapidly With These 4 Stupid Daily Habits

## 通过以下 4 个愚蠢的日常习惯快速减肥


People who are software developers spend many hours solving many problems, perpetually trying to always write better code. Long hours of problem-solving are draining even on the most resilient minds. Developers are often so engrossed with screens and lines of code that they never even realize that some of their daily habits are silly and working against their brain health.

软件开发人员会花费大量时间解决很多问题，并一直努力编写更好的代码。即使是最有弹性的头脑，长时间解决问题也会让人疲惫不堪。开发人员通常全神贯注于屏幕和代码行，以至于他们甚至没有意识到他们的一些日常习惯很愚蠢，并且对他们的大脑健康不利。  
>Habit 1: The Marathon Coding Sessions  
>习惯一：马拉松式编程

马拉松式编程指的是长时间、高强度地连续编写代码。这种习惯可能会导致效率降低、注意力不集中，甚至可能对健康造成负面影响。相反，我们应该采取更健康、更高效的编程方式，例如定时休息、小步快跑、保持专注等。

For many developers, working marathon coding sessions or pulling an all-nighter is almost a badge of honour. It becomes a normal case: something is due on the next day, for instance, a critical bug that needs to be worked on at once, or a new feature that needs to be completed by the end of the week.

对于许多开发人员来说，进行马拉松式的编程会议或通宵工作几乎是一种荣誉徽章。这已经成为一种常态：例如，第二天有事情要做，例如需要立即处理的关键错误，或者需要在本周末完成的新功能。





Extended periods of focused work without adequate resting or refreshment interrupt the natural rhythm of the brain. The brain, like any other muscle, needs rest time to recover and consolidate. As developers enter these marathon sessions, they abandon sleep, which is essential for cognitive operations, memory consolidation, and emotional regulation.

长时间的集中工作而没有适当的休息或恢复会打乱大脑的自然节奏。大脑和其他肌肉一样，需要休息时间来恢复和巩固。当开发人员进入这些马拉松式的工作时，他们会放弃睡眠，而睡眠对于认知操作、记忆巩固和情绪调节至关重要。

Sleep deprivation was established to lead to cognitive decline, a condition of inattention, and influences decision-making capacities. Prolonged sleep loss has been defined to affect neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer’s. Additionally, the lengthy periods of concentration during these coding marathons can lead to mental burnout, a degradation in creative energy, and even emotional depletion.

睡眠剥夺会导致认知能力下降、注意力不集中，并影响决策能力。长期睡眠不足已被定义为会影响阿尔茨海默病等神经退行性疾病。此外，在这些编码马拉松比赛中长时间的集中注意力会导致精神倦怠、创造性能量下降，甚至情绪枯竭。

The developers should engage in the development of strategies that include regular breaks, scheduling hours of work, and sticking to healthy sleep patterns. A good example would be the Pomodoro Technique, where one works for 25 minutes and then rests for 5. In addition, having clear boundaries around hours of work and a regular sleep routine would add to the contribution of healthy cognition and productivity.

开发者应该制定包括定期休息、安排工作时间和保持健康睡眠模式等策略。一个很好的例子是番茄工作法，即工作 25 分钟，然后休息 5 分钟。此外，明确工作时间和规律的睡眠时间将有助于提高认知能力和工作效率。  
>Habit 2: Inactivity towards Body Exercise  
>习惯 2：不积极进行身体锻炼

The frantic pace of technology has shrunk time for most ordinary people. Developers are no exception to this trend. They may find myriad reasons to sit idle rather than exercise.

科技的飞速发展让大多数普通人的时间变得更加紧凑。这一趋势也同样适用于开发者。他们可能会找到无数个理由坐着不动，而不是去锻炼。





Regular physical exercise is beneficial to the body but also necessary for the brain. It increases blood flow to the brain, increases, and sharpens important cognitive functions such as memory, attention, and problem-solving abilities. It will also help the release of neurotransmitters such as dopamine and serotonin, which are essential in mood regulation and mental clarity.

经常进行体育锻炼对身体有益，对大脑也很必要。它可以增加大脑的血液流量，提高和增强重要的认知功能，如记忆力、注意力和解决问题的能力。它还可以帮助释放多巴胺和血清素等神经递质，这些神经递质对情绪调节和思维清晰至关重要。

An inactive lifestyle can cause a person to suffer from poor blood flow, dull thinking, and increased vulnerability to the onset of mood disorders. In addition, an inactive lifestyle increases a person’s chances of developing obesity and heart disease, besides diabetes. All these are particularly bad for the brain.

久坐不动的生活方式会导致一个人血流不畅、思维迟钝，并且更容易患上情绪障碍。此外，久坐不动的生活方式会增加一个人肥胖、心脏病和糖尿病的几率。所有这些对大脑都特别不利。

Developers should make efforts to introduce activity into their lifestyle, however slight the exercise session is. It can be initiated with a few minutes of exercising per hour and increased to much more profound outcomes with the inclusion of brisk walks, stretches, or a standing desk at work. The difference comes from reminder shots to move every hour, and scheduling exercises to do regularly.

开发人员应该努力将活动融入他们的生活方式中，即使每次锻炼的时间很短。可以从每小时锻炼几分钟开始，然后通过增加快步走、伸展运动或在工作时使用站立式办公桌等方式，达到更深入的效果。区别在于每小时提醒一次移动，并定期安排锻炼。  
>Habit 3: Neglecting Mental Stimulation  
>习惯三：忽视心智刺激

However, the tech industry can trap developers into learning only what is required directly for work and, hence, continuous learning is important for professional growth. As if daily activity is ample to keep the mind stimulating, quite several developers leave out this from focus, and various risks will arise from cognitive stagnation.

然而，科技行业可能会使开发人员陷入只学习工作直接需要的知识的陷阱，因此持续学习对于职业发展很重要。就好像日常活动足以保持思维的刺激一样，相当多的开发人员忽略了这一点，认知停滞会带来各种风险。





When developers stop researching to find new knowledge or to intellectually stimulate themselves, the risk of cognitive stagnation looms overhead. Low problem-solving skills, reduced creative competence, and even higher risk of cognitive decline gradually decrease mental stimulation.

当开发人员停止研究以寻找新知识或激发自己的智力时，认知停滞的风险就会逼近。解决问题的能力降低，创造力下降，甚至认知能力下降的风险增加，都会逐渐减少对智力的刺激。

Engagement in various learning activities-for example, through reading books, taking up other hobbies, or exploring new fields, keeps the brain lively and quick. Continuous learning and intellectual stimulation are exactly what can be used to maintain healthy cognitive activity and enhance mental performance.

参与各种学习活动——例如，通过阅读书籍、培养其他爱好或探索新领域——可以保持大脑活跃和敏捷。持续的学习和智力刺激正是可以用来保持健康的认知活动和提高心理表现的方法。

To prevent their cognitive function from getting stale, developers should also look for learning activities outside of their operational environment. One can enrol in an online course, attend a tech meetup, and learn one or two new programming languages and frameworks. Even dedicating a little time each week towards something new will be greatly beneficial to overall cognitive health.

为了防止认知功能变得迟钝，开发人员还应该在操作环境之外寻找学习活动。可以注册在线课程、参加技术聚会，学习一两种新的编程语言和框架。即使每周花一点时间在新事物上，也会对整体认知健康有很大的好处。  
>Habit 4: Neglecting Social Connections  
>习惯四：忽视社交关系

Coding puts developers in isolation by the fact that only a lone sits and focuses mainly on work and sets aside interactions. Also, this is a habit one usually overlooks, which can greatly affect mental health and cognitive functions.

编程会使开发人员孤立，因为他们只能独自坐在那里，主要专注于工作，而将交互放在一边。此外，这是一个人们通常会忽略的习惯，它会极大地影响心理健康和认知功能。





Strong social relationships provide an opening towards the good maintenance of mental health. The stresses of life are aided by communicating with others and stimulating cognitive functions through worthwhile conversations and experiences.

强大的社会关系为保持心理健康提供了一个突破口。通过与他人交流和通过有意义的对话和体验来刺激认知功能，可以缓解生活中的压力。

Various psychological conditions attributed to loneliness and isolation include depression and anxiety, among other cognitive decline. This form of isolation leaves developers feeling unrefreshed and besides getting overall dissatisfaction in terms of jobs.

各种归因于孤独和隔离的心理状况包括抑郁和焦虑等认知能力下降。这种隔离形式会让开发人员感到疲惫不堪，除了在工作方面感到总体不满之外。

A developer needs to be one to be able to maintain work and personal life and for time allocated to social activities as well as to the maintenance of family and friend relations. Such activities as team building activities, professional groups, or even informal social gatherings that can bring people closer together and enhance mental states are all contributive factors. Reaching out to colleagues and friends daily, even if just to pass a word here and there, could also contribute to greater living and improved well-being.

要想维持工作和个人生活的平衡，以及分配时间用于社交活动、维护家庭和朋友关系，就需要具备一定的能力。团队建设活动、专业团体，甚至非正式的社交聚会等活动都有助于拉近人们之间的距离，改善精神状态。每天与同事和朋友联系，即使只是说几句话，也有助于提高生活质量和幸福感。
## Conclusion

## 结论


These habits appear trivial, but when one develops them over time, the danger to brain health escalates. Developers caught in the whirlwind of deadlines and coding challenges rarely pay attention to their selves or, indeed know the extent to which self-care impacts cognitive function. Developers may become aware of these toxic habits such as marathon coding sessions, lack of exercise, ignoring mental stimulation, and social isolation, etc. They can then take action proactively to protect their brain health and thus improve themselves.

这些习惯看起来微不足道，但随着时间的推移，它们对大脑健康的危害会逐渐加剧。开发人员在赶项目进度和应对编程挑战的漩涡中，很少会关注自己，也很少知道自我保健对认知功能的影响程度。开发人员可能会意识到这些有毒习惯，如长时间编码、缺乏锻炼、忽视精神刺激和社交孤立等，然后积极采取行动保护大脑健康，从而提高自己。

The quintessential change toward the adoption of healthy habits, work-life balance with adequate rest and exercise, continuous learning, and social engagement will go a long way in assuring and sustaining long-term healthy cognition. Given the high-level work environment of software development, these changes are not only beneficial but rather crucial to professional success and personal happiness as well. Such steps will thus ensure developers preserve their brain health while remaining successful in both their career and personal lives.

向养成健康习惯、工作与生活平衡（保证充足的休息和锻炼）、持续学习和社会参与转变是确保和维持长期健康认知的关键。鉴于软件开发的高水平工作环境，这些改变不仅有益，而且对专业成功和个人幸福至关重要。因此，这些措施将确保开发人员在保持大脑健康的同时，在职业和个人生活中都取得成功。
