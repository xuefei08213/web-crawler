Everything changes so fast these days that, standing out as a developer is more important than ever. As much as your technical skills matter, in this sea of programmers, it's your personal touch that can truly set you apart. 

如今，一切变化都如此之快，作为一名开发者，脱颖而出比以往任何时候都更加重要。尽管你的技术技能很重要，但在这个程序员的海洋中，真正能让你脱颖而出的是你的个人风格。

But how can you create your personal brand? How to apply your personal brand to your presentations and public persona? In this article, we'll walk you through the process of creating a personal brand, showcasing yourself to the public, and leaving a long-lasting mark in the developer community.

但是，你如何才能打造个人品牌呢？如何将个人品牌应用于演示文稿和公众形象中呢？在本文中，我们将引导你完成创建个人品牌、向公众展示自己以及在开发者社区中留下持久印记的过程。
## So, what’s branding actually?

## 那么，品牌到底是什么呢？


Branding, in the context of personal branding, is all about creating a unique identity that encapsulates your skills, experiences, and values. It's how you present yourself to the world. It doesn’t always need to be related to you as a person though — there are numerous branding guides for companies and how they present themselves too!

在个人品牌建设的背景下，品牌建设就是要打造一个独特的身份，它包含了你的技能、经验和价值观。它是你向世界展示自己的方式。不过，它并不总是与你个人有关——也有许多关于公司及其自我展示方式的品牌建设指南！

When it comes to personal branding, consistency is essential. Your brand should be an authentic representation of who you are, and it should remain consistent across different platforms and interactions. This means that the way you present yourself in your portfolio, on your social media platforms, and in person should all align with your personal brand. Besides that, your brand is not just about how you present yourself, but also how others perceive you. This includes the quality of your work, your work ethic, your communication style, and even your personality traits.

当涉及到个人品牌时，一致性是至关重要的。你的品牌应该是你真实自我的代表，并且在不同的平台和互动中应该保持一致。这意味着你在个人资料、社交媒体平台和个人形象中呈现自己的方式都应该与你的个人品牌保持一致。此外，你的品牌不仅关乎你如何展示自己，还关乎别人如何看待你。这包括你的工作质量、职业道德、沟通风格，甚至你的个性特征。

Now, let me show you an example of how I sell my image, and let’s start breaking down everything you need to know on how to do it too!

现在，让我给你展示一个我如何销售自己形象的例子，让我们开始分解你需要知道的所有关于如何做到这一点的细节！
### First of all, the theme

### 首先，主题


Here’s a GIF of my portfolio (and you can find it here in case you want to check it for yourself). So, first of all, let’s see if we can spot a clear theme:

这是我的作品集的 GIF 动画（如果你想自己查看，可以在这里找到它）。所以，首先，让我们看看是否可以发现一个清晰的主题：  
![](https://media.dev.to/cdn-cgi/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2Fjx6aj5so1fdylnsqhd4b.gif)





The bright contrast in the colors, the 8-bit font, the big buttons, writing animations, and a simple avatar image. The theme is clear: Games!

鲜明的色彩对比、8 位字体、大按钮、书写动画以及一个简单的头像图片。主题很明确：游戏！

Besides that, the first initial phrase “Welcome adventurer” is a classical phrase for a specific genre of games: RPG/Medieval Games!

除此之外，第一句话“欢迎冒险者”是特定类型游戏（角色扮演/中世纪游戏）中的经典短语！

Great! Now, why did I choose this theme? Randomly? When the user checks the about me section, he’ll discover:

太棒了！现在，我为什么选择这个主题呢？是随机的吗？当用户查看关于我部分时，他会发现：  
![](https://media.dev.to/cdn-cgi/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2Fwrdtejc35czpew8ghh01.png)





So there we go! The theme is not only consistent on all the UI, but it also contains a fragment of my personality — being a tabletop RPG Dungeon Master — on it. Defining a theme for yourself can be hard, but, starting to think about the hobbies and things that you enjoy in your personal life can give a great personal touch to your brand!

那么，就这样！这个主题不仅在所有的用户界面上保持一致，而且还包含了我个人的一小部分——作为一个桌面角色扮演游戏的地下城主。为自己定义一个主题可能很难，但从个人生活中的爱好和喜欢的事情开始思考，可以为你的品牌带来很大的个人特色！
## Building Your Personal Brand

## 建立个人品牌


Now that we have a clear understanding of what personal branding is, let's move on to the next step - building your personal brand. This process involves identifying your unique strengths and skills, defining your target audience, and finally, crafting your brand.

既然我们已经清楚地了解了个人品牌是什么，那么接下来就进入下一步——建立你的个人品牌。这个过程包括确定你的独特优势和技能，确定你的目标受众，最后，精心打造你的品牌。
### Identifying Your Unique Strengths and Skills

### 确定自己的独特优势和技能
  
![](https://media.dev.to/cdn-cgi/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2Fc6h5xwcae7llprx2vjjt.png)





To begin with, it’s a good idea to try to identify what makes you unique as a developer. A helpful tool for this is a SWOT matrix, where you list your Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, and Threats. Strengths could be your technical abilities or soft skills like communication and other ways you approach problems on a day-to-day basis. Weaknesses are areas where you could improve. Opportunities could be networking, open-source contributions, or learning new technologies and Threats could be things like a highly competitive job market or the rapid pace of technological change.

首先，试着确定作为一名开发人员，你有哪些独特之处是一个好主意。SWOT 矩阵是一个有用的工具，其中你可以列出你的优势、劣势、机会和威胁。优势可能是你的技术能力或软技能，如沟通和其他你在日常生活中解决问题的方法。劣势是你可以改进的地方。机会可能是建立人脉、开源贡献或学习新技术，而威胁可能是竞争激烈的就业市场或技术快速变化等问题。
### Defining Your Target Audience

### 确定目标受众

Next, you need to define who your target audience is. These are the people you want to reach with your personal brand - potential employers, colleagues, or the broader developer community. Having a clear understanding of your target audience will help you tailor your brand to appeal to them. In the case of my portfolio, for example, it’s clearly tailored to potential employers!

接下来，你需要确定你的目标受众是谁。这些是你希望通过个人品牌吸引的人——潜在雇主、同事或更广泛的开发者社区。明确目标受众将帮助你根据他们的需求定制你的品牌。以我的作品集为例，它显然是为潜在雇主量身定制的！
### Crafting Your Personal Brand

### 打造个人品牌


Once you've identified your strengths and skills and defined your target audience, you can begin crafting your personal brand. This involves deciding on a consistent image or theme (like the game theme I showed above) and communicating your values and skills. 

一旦你确定了自己的优势和技能，并明确了目标受众，就可以开始打造个人品牌了。这包括确定一致的形象或主题（比如我上面展示的游戏主题），并传达你的价值观和技能。

This is also usable in the context of new brands and ideas! For example, at Webcrumbs — a great OSS plugin system, that can really streamline your development process — they started from zero and have now reached a point where the brand stands on solid ground with colors, icons, and themes that certainly cuts an impression (and even more than that, makes them memorable)!

这同样适用于新品牌和新创意！例如，在 Webcrumbs——一个很棒的 OSS 插件系统，可以真正简化你的开发流程——他们从零开始，现在已经达到了一个品牌拥有稳定的颜色、图标和主题的地步，这肯定会给人留下深刻的印象（甚至更重要的是，让人难以忘怀）！
## Showcasing Yourself to the Public

## 展示自己给公众


Having crafted your personal brand, the next step is to showcase it to the public. This involves creating an online presence that aligns with your brand. Honestly, this can be achieved in a bunch of different ways: e.g. building a portfolio website that highlights your work and skills, or even leveraging social media platforms and GitHub to reach a wider audience.

塑造好个人品牌后，下一步就是向公众展示它。这涉及到创建一个与品牌相符的在线形象。坦白说，这可以通过多种不同的方式实现：例如，建立一个作品集网站，突出展示你的作品和技能，甚至利用社交媒体平台和 GitHub 来吸引更广泛的受众。

Just make sure that, whenever you’re using a brand as a communication focus, keep the same communication tone and other aspects throughout different platforms. If you’re funny and casual everywhere, it’s not because you’re on LinkedIn that you’re not going to be casual anymore. Retain some professionalism (which is LinkedIn’s case in the general tone that exists there), but try to be as much casual as you’d be in your portfolio communications.

只要确保，无论何时你将品牌作为沟通重点，在不同平台上保持相同的沟通语气和其他方面。如果你在任何地方都很风趣和随意，那并不是因为你在领英上就不再随意了。保持一些专业性（这是领英在其整体语气中的情况），但要尽量像在你的作品集沟通中那样随意。

## Leaving a Mark in the Developer Community

## 在开发者社区留下足迹


There are other forms that you can create a personal brand, and, one of the bigger ones is leaving a mark in our community. This can be achieved through a variety of different ways, from networking to contributing to open-source projects, and even just sharing your knowledge with others! All those ideas present an opportunity for you to showcase your work and skills, and even more than that, your personal self to others.

还有其他方式可以打造个人品牌，其中一个较大的方式是在我们的社区留下印记。你可以通过各种不同的方式来实现，例如建立人际关系网、参与开源项目，甚至只是与他人分享你的知识！所有这些想法都为你提供了一个展示你的工作和技能的机会，甚至更多的是向他人展示你的个人特质。
### Networking and Building Connections

### 建立人际关系和网络


Networking is a crucial part of building your brand. Try to attend industry events, join online forums/Reddit, and participate in developer communities. Introduce yourself, share your work, and engage with others. Building genuine relationships can help you establish a strong reputation and open up new opportunities — to be honest with you, a bunch of different projects I’ve participated in became opportunities just because I had good connections, formed throughout the daily work with the people making it, so, I can’t stress enough how important this is!

建立自己的品牌是至关重要的。尝试参加行业活动、加入在线论坛/红迪网，参与开发者社区。介绍自己，分享你的工作，并与他人互动。建立真正的关系可以帮助你建立良好的声誉，并开辟新的机会——说实话，我参与的许多不同项目之所以成为机会，只是因为我有良好的人际关系，这是在与项目组成员的日常工作中建立起来的，所以，我怎么强调这一点都不为过！
### Contributing to Open-Source Projects

### 为开源项目做贡献


Another really cool way to create your brand is to contribute to open-source projects. It is a great way to showcase your skills and give back to the community on things you enjoy while also providing an excellent opportunity to collaborate with other developers and learn from them. 

另一种创建品牌的很酷的方法是为开源项目做出贡献。这是一种展示你技能的好方法，同时也是回馈你喜欢的社区的一种极好的方式，还为你提供了与其他开发人员合作并向他们学习的绝佳机会。

Your contributions can serve as a testament to your expertise and dedication, enhancing your brand and serving as proof of trust about the quality of your work — a few positions even ask for your personal contributions while in the interview.

你的贡献可以证明你的专业知识和奉献精神，增强你的品牌，并证明你工作质量的可信度——甚至有一些职位在面试时会要求你提供个人贡献。

Here at Webcrumbs, we’re actually Open-Source, so if you’re looking somewhere to start contributing to and you’re looking for places that you can have a lot of impact, feel free to star us and check our issues! Also, in case you haven't checked out the launch, here's a quick link for it:

### Sharing Knowledge Through Blogging and Journaling

### 通过博客和日志分享知识


Sharing your knowledge through blogging or vlogging can position you as a thought leader in your field. Write about your experiences, share tutorials, or discuss industry trends. This not only helps others but also reinforces your expertise and passion for your work. Consistently producing quality content can significantly boost your personal brand.

通过博客或视频博客分享你的知识可以让你在自己的领域成为一个思想领袖。写一些你的经历，分享教程，或者讨论行业趋势。这不仅可以帮助他人，还可以加强你对工作的专业知识和热情。持续输出高质量的内容可以显著提升你的个人品牌。

This was part of the reason I’ve actually begun to write here. After receiving some great feedback at work, I started to think of ways that I could share my knowledge with other people and show a few opinions and takes I had in software engineering. I can’t recommend enough how journaling your journey can impact your life — it’s a really powerful and yet simple habit.

这也是我开始在这里写作的部分原因。在工作中得到一些很好的反馈后，我开始思考如何与其他人分享我的知识，并展示我在软件工程方面的一些观点和看法。我强烈推荐写日记对你的生活产生的影响——这是一个非常强大但简单的习惯。
